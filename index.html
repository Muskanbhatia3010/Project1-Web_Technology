      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the ever-evolving world of web development, CSS continues to play a pivotal role in shaping modern user
        experiences. Over the years, CSS has grown from a basic styling language into a robust toolkit for creating
        dynamic and visually appealing web pages. Upcoming CSS technologies, such as view transitions, motion paths,
        and scroll-driven animations, aim to simplify workflows, improve performance, and provide developers with more
        creative possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page explores some of the most exciting advancements in CSS, demonstrating how these features empower
        developers to craft smoother animations, more intuitive designs, and interactive content with less code. From
        nesting styles to creating seamless page transitions, these innovations are set to redefine what's possible
        with web design. Let’s dive in!
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- View Transitions -->
    <section class="View-Transition">
      <h2 id="view-transitions">View Transitions</h2>
      <h3>Introduction to the View Transitions API</h3>
      <p>
        The View Transitions API is a powerful tool that enables developers to
        create smooth, animated transitions between different states of a
        website or application. It provides a simple mechanism for animating
        changes in the Document Object Model (DOM), enhancing user experience
        with visually appealing transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, the API was primarily used for same-document transitions in
        single-page applications (SPAs). However, its capabilities have
        expanded to include cross-document transitions, making it valuable for
        multi-page applications (MPAs) as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Cross-Document View Transitions</h3>
      <p>
        Cross-document view transitions allow for seamless visual transitions
        between different pages in an MPA. This feature, supported from Chrome
        126 onwards, enables developers to create fluid navigation experiences
        similar to those in SPAs, but across separate HTML documents
      </p>
      <h4>Before:</h4>
      <embed src="https://laust.ca/projects/country/" style="width:1200px; height: 700px;">
      <!-- need to change inline styling -->
      <!-- Not sure if we can have h4 before h3? -->
      <h4>After:</h4>
      <embed src="https://laust.ca/projects/country-view/" style="width:1200px; height: 700px;">
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        1. First let's make sure all the pages that we want to seamlessly
        transition between has this meta tag
      </p>
      <h4>HTML:</h4>
      <pre>
  <code>
    &lt;meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin"&gt;
  </code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        This meta tag lets the browser know to call the View Transitions API
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Then let's make sure all the pages that we want to seamlessly
        transition between opts in via CSS
      </p>
      <h4>CSS:</h4>
      <pre>
  <code>
    @view-transition {
      navigation: auto;
    }
  
    ::view-transition-old(root),
    ::view-transition-new(root) {
        animation-duration: 1s;
    }
  </code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        This CSS rule enables view transitions for cross-document, same-origin
        navigations
      </p>
      <p>
        The pseudo elements "::view-transition-old(root) and
        ::view-transition-new(root)" Apply animations to the old and new root
        elements during the transition.
      </p>

    <!-- CSS Nesting -->

    <section class="CSS-Nesting">
      <h2 id="css-nesting">CSS Nesting</h2>
      <h3>Introduction to CSS Nesting</h3>
      <p>
        CSS Nesting is a new feature in CSS that allows developers to write nested selectors directly within CSS
        rules.
        This feature brings CSS closer to the organization and readability of popular pre-processors like Sass and
        LESS,
        making it easier to style complex components without excessive selector repetition.
        Before CSS Nesting, developers relied on pre-processors to structure CSS code more hierarchically. Now, native
        CSS can handle nested rules, reducing the need for pre-processors and creating cleaner, more maintainable
        code.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Use CSS Nesting?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Improved Readability</b>:
          <span>CSS Nesting makes code more readable by visually grouping related styles. This allows developers to
            see
            the structure of the HTML within the CSS, making it easier to understand and maintain.</span>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reduced Redundancy</b>: <span>By nesting selectors, we can avoid repeating parent selectors, which
            helps
            keep CSS files cleaner and less repetitive.</span></li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Code Organization</b>:<span>With CSS Nesting, you can structure your CSS in a way that mirrors
            the HTML hierarchy, making it easier to work with complex components and nested elements.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How would you style this code using CSS?</h3>
      <pre>
  <code>
   &lt;section class="card"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card Title&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief description inside the card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Read More&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
      <h3>Before vs. After CSS Nesting</h3>
      <h3>CSS Code:</h3>
      <div id="code-preview-container">
        <pre id="css-code-block"></pre>
        <div id="preview-area">
          <div class="card">

    <!-- CSS Motion Path-->

    <section class="CSS-Motionpath">
      <h2 id="css-motion-path">CSS Motion Path</h2>
      <p>CSS motion path is a CSS property used to animate an element along a path.</p>
      <p>Previously, only simple, linear movements were possible in CSS.</p>
      <h3>Try the following code in the editor below</h3>
      <pre>
  <code>

  height: 50px;
  animation: move1 infinite 1s linear;

      <div class="css-editor-section">
        <textarea id="css-editor-old" placeholder="Type CSS here for the old animation..."></textarea>
      </div>
      <!-- Old Animation Preview -->

    <!-- Scroll Driven Animation -->
    <section class="Scroll-Driven-Animation">
      <h2 id="scroll-driven-animation">Scroll-driven-animation</h2>
      <h3>Introduction of the Scroll-driven-animation</h3>
      <p>Scroll-based animation is a common UX pattern on the web. It links the animation to the scroll position of a
        scroll container. In other words, as you scroll up or down, the connected animations respond directly by
        scrubbing back and forth. Effects like parallax background images or reading indicators fall under this
        category. Scroll-animation allows CSS animations to be directly linked to the scroll position of a webpage.
        This
        means that as the user scrolls, the animations can start, progress, or end based on how far they have
        scrolled.
      </p>
      <h3>What are animation timelines?</h3>
      <p>Before diving into scroll-driven animations, we first need to understand what animation timelines are.
        Historically, the only animation timeline that existed was the document timeline which will start incrementing
        when the page loads. As long as the page remains open, the document timeline will continue to increment. We
        can
        observe this by logging the document.timeline variable in our console.</p>
      <code>
          &lt; "document.timeline" in Javascript&gt;
        </code>
      <p>scroll-driven animations are based on scroll progress and not time durations, the document timeline doesn’t
        make sense when starting to think about animating elements based on scroll position. This is why scroll-driven
        animations introduced the animation-timeline property which allows us to target two new types of animation
        timelines that will be used to create scroll-driven animations.</p>
      <h3>Role of Scroll-driven animation</h3>
      <p>The Scroll-driven animation allows for defining how animations progress according to the scroll position of a
        specific element. As users scroll down the page, the animation can start or end based on the scroll position.
        This allows developers to create animations that play in sync with the user's scrolling behavior.</p>
      <h3>Introduction to new types of scroll-based timelines and property</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Scroll progress timeline:</b> You progress this timeline by scrolling a scrollable element (scroller)
          from top
          to bottom (or left to right) and back again. The position in the scroll range is converted into a percentage
          of progress — 0% at the start and 100% at the end.</li><br>
        <li><b>Animation-range:</b> The animation-range CSS shorthand property is used to set the start and end of an
          animation's attachment range along its timeline, i.e. where along the timeline an animation will start and
          end.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Using the Scroll-driven animation</h3>
      <h4>Add the following code to see how Scroll() works</h4>
        <pre>
<code>
#bear-image {
  animation-name: rotateAnimation;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block nearest);
}
@keyframes rotateAnimation {
from {
  transform: rotate(0deg);
}
to {
  transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
}
    </code>
  </pre>
      <div class="css-editor-section">
        <textarea id="css-editor-scroll" placeholder="Type CSS here for the old animation..."></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-container-1">
        <img id="bear-image" src="images/mole.png" alt="bear">
        <div id="stretcher"></div>
      </div>
      <h3>Using the Animation Range</h3>
      <h4>Add the following CSS code for Animation range</h4>
<pre>
<code>
@keyframes header {
  from {
  backdrop-filter: blur(0);
  background: transparent;
  }
  
  to {
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
  background: rgba(83, 117, 173, 0.75);
  }
}
  
  .scroll-nav,
  .scroll-nav > h2 {
    animation: header linear forwards;
    animation-timeline: scroll();
    animation-range: 0 80px;
